ArcPro tool to streamline landcover change analysis

## Summary
The purpose of this tool is to streamline a process that I have found myself 
doing several times when doing change detection analysis. This tool combines 
three tools that already exist in ArcPro. If successful, the tool will take two
rasters as inputs and return a single raster that details the landcover change
between the first and second raster.
