# ArcProLCchangetool
ArcPro tool to streamline landcover change analysis

## Summary
The purpose of this tool is to streamline a process that I have found myself 
doing several times when doing change detection analysis. This tool combines 
two tools that already exist in ArcPro. If successful, the tool will take two
rasters of the same area at different points in time as inputs and return a single raster 
that details the change
between the first and second raster.

## What?
This tool combines the Unsupervised ISO Cluster Classification 
tool and the Plus tool to generate a change detection raster that detailschange on
a pixel by pixel basis.

## Why?
Change analysis is a common type of analysis in GIS.
I especially wanted to create this tool after I worked on a project in which
I looked at landcover change for the same area across multiple years. Having a
tool that streamlined the process would've helped me save time.

## Usage
The tool would be most useful for landcover change analysis as was done in the 
aforementioned project on which this project was based.
